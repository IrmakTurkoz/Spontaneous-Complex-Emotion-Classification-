# Spontaneous-Complex-Emotion-Classification-
Unlike the literature with six basic emotions classification, this project extends the pool of learned expression to thirteen classes. Moreover, the classified subjects are spontaneous, which is more challenging to detect. The project has concluded with slightly better accuracy than the literature with LSTM, LBP, and MFCC
Multi-modal facial emotion recognition is one of the
more challenging tasks of computer vision. Previous work has
been primarily focused on six basic emotions. This project focus
on non-basic simultaneous emotion/expression classification. We
extend the pool of learned expression to thirteen classes by the
addition of mental states such as thinking, concentrated, and etc.
We also mention results currently available in the literature and
draw comparisons with our own. To best of our knowledge, the
accuracy obtained by our models is higher than those available
in the literature.
